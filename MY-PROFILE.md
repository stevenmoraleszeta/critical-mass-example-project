# 👋 Hi, I'm Steven!

💻 **Full Stack Software Engineer | Tech Leader | Product-Driven Developer | Creative Technologist**  

📍 Costa Rica  

💡 I'm passionate about building **robust, scalable, and meaningful innovations** that connect technology, creativity, and real human needs.  

🚀 I love leading projects, designing user-centered architectures, and turning ideas into **impactful products** that make a difference.  

🌍 I've always been inspired by the idea that, as Anne Frank once said, *"we don't need to wait a single moment to start changing the world."*  

💭 And I deeply believe, like Steve Jobs, that *"it's the ones bold — or crazy — enough to think they can do it, who actually do."*  

🔥 I carry both ideas with me every day: the urgency to act, and the audacity to dream big.  

🤖 That's why I build technology — not just to solve problems, but to **help shape a better, more conscious future.**
